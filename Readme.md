# Bornhack Badge 2023

This is some custom proof of concept code working with mainly the "reader" part of the Bornhack 2023 badge.
At the moment I'm mainly focussing on card emulation though (thus the quotes around "reader") because that sounds fun to have as a little gadget and learn a lot on the way.

I'm planning on working with Zephyr later on but for now I'll use Circuitpython as it comes pre flashed with the badge and it's actually quite comfortable to use for playing around with the tag.

Also, in this state, this project is mainly meant to be entertaining and educational for me.

I am willingly, probably more or less, reinventing the wheel here to really get familiar with the technology.
